# NOTEBOOKS
In this folder we stored the jupyter notebooks used to test the different functions that we weren't a 100% sure of how they would react. 
We used the following folders for different tasks to solve:
    - data_preprocessing.ipynb: Used this file to play around with the data we found to observe what different things we could do to use as observations.
    - filter.ipynb: Used to try out the filters. Just wanted to make sure they were working correctly. We ran filters here and checked that the results
    were the same as in the app.py
    - linear_regression.ipynb: Tried out the linear regression here for the prediction of the houses' price.
    - merge_all_dfs.ipynb: Used to merge all the different dataframes we obtained to have only one to work on.
    - neural_networks_local.ipynb: Used to test the neural network for the prediction of the houses' price. This is probably the one we used most because it took us longer to figure out. 
    This version is ran locally for the teammates that didn't have technical issues with locally running tensorflow.
    - neural_networks.ipynb: Used to test the neural network for the prediction of the houses' price. This is probably the one we used most because it took us longer to figure out. 
    Ran in google colab because of technical issues with locally running tensorflow.
    - nn_for_api.ipynb: 
    - nn_local_simplified.ipynb:
